This code was written by Christopher Henry, Renata Ivanek, Michelle Wemette, and
Ece Bulut. Additional work on writing and reviewing documentation, catching
erroneous output, making suggestions, etc. was done by Sarah I. Murphy,
Sebastian Llanos-Soto, Claire Zoellner, and Diane Wetherington. Additional
thanks is due to iFoodDecisionSciences (iFoodDS), who developed a web
interface for this model, and who have helped with background information,
debugging, suggestions and requests for output features, etc.

This model was developed for:
R version 4.1.1 (2021-08-10) -- "Kick Things"
Copyright (C) 2021 The R Foundation for Statistical Computing
Platform: x86_64-pc-linux-gnu (64-bit)

The following package versions were used in development and testing:
doParallel_1.0.16
iterators_1.0.13
foreach_1.5.1
Rlab_2.15.1      
Matrix_1.3-4

Some of these may be safe to omit, with light code editing.

Efforts have been made to keep comments and other documentation up to date,
but it is possible that some comments may be out of date, in accordance with
the principle that documentation is *always* out of date.
